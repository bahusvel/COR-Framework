# Supervisor
COR-Framework introduces new concepts: supervised modules and supervisors

Supervised modules allow COR-Modules to be automatically managed (launched, killed, debugged, restarted) through supervisor whichis a special COR-Module that is installed once per host machine. Supervisor allows multiple hosts to be networked together to build a COR-Pool which can be used to deploy modules to. Users simply define the application they would like to be deployed to the COR-Pool and supervisor automatically uploads modules to the right places and runs them according to declaration in the application specification.
