# Supervisor
COR-Framework introduces new concepts: supervised modules and supervisors

Supervised modules allow COR-Modules to be automatically managed (launched, killed, debugged, restarted) through supervisor whichis a special COR-Module that is installed once per host machine. Supervisor allows multiple hosts to be networked together to build a COR-Pool which can be used to deploy modules to. Users simply define the application they would like to be deployed to the COR-Pool and supervisor automatically uploads modules to the right places and runs them according to declaration in the application specification.

# Supervised Modules
A module that can be supervised needs to do the following:

1. Override the main method passing all its arguments to COR-Framework 
`supervised_init(args)`
2. Override the default `on_config(config)` method where module will receive a configuration message, that it must use to configure itself
3. Override the default `on_start()` method where it must perform any routines required to start the module, before this method is called module must not send any messages to the COR-Network

COR-Framework will also provide methods that are optional for the module to override, those methods will provide more information to the module regarding its state:
* `on_recover()` will be called when module has previously failed and is being restarted, default implementation will call the `on_start()` method.
* `on_stop()` will be called when the supervisor wants to stop the module, and it gives the opportunity for the module to clean up before it is killed

# Additional features
* Logging facility to ship the logs to supervisor or modules who are connected to receive this data via CORLOG message type
